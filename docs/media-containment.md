# Multimedia containment

## Android decoder boundary

Still-image decode and inspection, EXIF inspection and SVG preparation use a nonexported `android:isolatedProcess` service. The worker has a separate UID and no application permissions. Application startup skips account state, diagnostics, locale preferences, playback, transfers and background scheduling in that process.

The app lazily binds one serialized image worker. Video poster/duration probes and voice waveform extraction use a separate, process-wide serialized platform-service adapter. Android denies `media.player` and `media.extractor` discovery to isolated UIDs on API 30; attempting those operations in the image worker is unsupported. This is an explicit route, with no isolated-attempt/privileged-fallback sequence. A slow waveform must not occupy the notification-avatar lane. Production calls on the main looper or without a configured transport fail closed. JVM tests explicitly inject their codec fixture; those tests do not prove process isolation.

Input bytes are written only after their temporary file is unlinked, then passed by read-only descriptor. Picked images and media use a process-wide staging gate, with provider cancellation and bounded reads. Whole-file seekable videos pass their descriptor without a full-video array copy. Provider subranges are copied into their own unlinked inode, so a decoder cannot read bytes outside the selected asset. No URLs, account objects, keys or general file-access callback enter the worker.

The app owns bounded output shared memory. Replies use an explicit primitive Binder format with a per-request callback capability, kernel caller UID, first-response fencing. The app validates dimensions, byte capacity, image metadata and output protection, then copies software ARGB8888 pixels into an app-owned bitmap. It never displays mutable worker memory directly or re-decodes compressed image output. Shared-memory protection cannot revoke a worker's existing writable mapping; the bounded copy confines concurrent mutation to pixel values.

Debug instrumentation may pass the exact path of an existing synthetic `media-containment-canary`. It tests that the worker cannot reopen that file, including permission denial or namespace invisibility. No real account files are probed, and release requests omit this field.

## Limits and failure

- Encoded image input: at most 64 MiB. Existing receive/presentation limits may be lower and remain in force.
- Static source canvas: at most 32768 pixels per edge and 200 million pixels before sampled raster allocation.
- Output edge: at most 4096 pixels; parent-owned output: at most 64 MiB. Existing avatar, thumbnail, viewer and editor profiles remain tighter.
- Existing GIF/WebP canvas/frame/work admission precedes every still or animated decode. A refused animation cannot bypass admission through its first frame.
- File media probes: at most 512 MiB, with validated descriptor offsets and lengths; this is not an attachment transfer quota.
- Image worker watchdog: 6 seconds, with an 8-second host wait. An interrupted dispatched request also asks the worker to retire through its control looper. A worker still alive after timeout/cancellation blocks replacement admission; a system-confirmed death permits a fresh generation.
- Platform media: one process-wide operation, admitted before opening/staging inputs. Caller waits are bounded at 8 seconds for probes and 40 seconds for waveforms, plus bounded admission. Audio loops check cancellation and a 30-second decode ceiling. A timed-out native call keeps its slot until it actually terminates; account reset cannot create a parallel replacement thread. Late posters are recycled and retired results are discarded. The app cannot safely force-kill an in-process native call.
- Failed source revisions have bounded in-memory quarantine. Account teardown retires the image worker, media delivery and pending reply capabilities; host cache-generation checks remain authoritative for UI publication.

Native temporary allocations are not bounded solely by output dimensions. Worker isolation and watchdogs contain ordinary faults but cannot force a compromised worker to obey its own watchdog or prevent a kernel/system-service escape. A malicious provider that ignores cancellation can hold one admitted off-main staging operation; new readers must not bypass its gate.

Android media services perform platform extraction and codec work, but their JNI/Binder clients remain in the app process. Descriptor bounds and serialized deadlines reduce exposure; they do not provide the image worker’s UID/private-data/network boundary. Platform metadata is validated and waveforms must contain exactly 64 finite normalized values.

HEIF/HEIC is not qualified by the JPEG/PNG tests. Some Android image implementations internally need media services unavailable to an isolated UID. Such formats fail closed if unsupported, without an app-process image fallback.

## Automatic versus explicit parsing

Remote timeline/GIPHY images and profile/list avatar overlays use isolated first frames. Admitted native animation is enabled only in the user-opened current media/avatar viewer, with existing visibility, motion and lifecycle controls. Composer previews also use isolated still frames because an external share intent does not attest a playback gesture. Outgoing original animation bytes retain their existing format/admission contract. `AnimatedImageDrawable` playback still uses the app process; full animation isolation requires separately qualified frame/surface IPC.

Received and picked video playback uses local file/content inputs and an explicit progressive source, rather than choosing a network/playlist protocol from its suffix. Media3 container extractors still execute in the app during explicit playback. Platform codec isolation is useful but does not isolate every Media3 parser. Referenced Nostr-event networking retains its existing owner and explicit loading policy.

## MDK boundary

MDK retains reference validation, authenticated encryption/hash verification, safe public-address/TLS/redirect transport, transfer policy, resumable acquisition and retained state. Native receive memory and low-space recovery remain tracked by [MDK #2241](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/2241) and [MDK #2239](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/2239). Shared public-image qualification/admission remains [MDK #2232](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/2232). This Android boundary neither duplicates those rules nor claims an upstream fix is shipped.

## Qualification

Unit fixtures cover pixel limits, malformed bytes, primitive reply validation and explicit fail-closed transport. Hosted instrumentation must prove real UID separation, pixel fidelity, malformed-input recovery, account-reset behavior and real descriptor-based SVG/EXIF operations. Separate platform tests qualify video poster/duration and PCM waveform behavior; those tests do not attest image-worker isolation for media services. Physical testing additionally checks OS process identity, private-data/network denial, hung-worker death, descriptor/RSS stability, normal image/animation compatibility, SVG, poster/waveform output and large seekable video sources. Record exact source and APK bytes; installation alone is not feature coverage. API 30 compatibility needs its own emulator/device evidence. Do not treat unchecked manual cases or a JVM fake as completed device proof.

## Photo compatibility and budget refusals

Inspection and the editor share a 200-million-pixel source limit and a 32768-pixel
source-edge limit. Decoded output remains capped at 4096 pixels on its longest edge
and 64 MiB. A tight crop may require a larger full-source decode even when its final
output is smaller: refuse that operation before IPC and explain the processing
limit while retaining the previous attachment. Do not clamp the decode and upscale
it into a misleading high-quality output. Isolated region decoding is future work.
The editor budgets the shared pixel buffer and returned host bitmap concurrently,
as well as rendering and encoding peaks.

Unavailable waveform results are not cached: contention, startup or account reset
may be transient. Successful waveforms retain their bounded cache. SVG rasterization
checks the final host-encoded PNG against the existing upload size limit as well as
the worker's encoded output. Restored video sources outside file/content schemes
are refused before player construction and use the existing filename preview.
Instrumentation artifacts are labelled with the built checkout SHA: a PR-triggered
run normally tests its merge revision, while a branch dispatch tests that branch.

Unavailable EXIF replies remain unknown. Original-quality and animated metadata
preparation refuse that operation instead of stripping orientation under an
unconfirmed upright assumption. A later healthy request may retry normally.

Optional notification emoji decoding is interruptible so its short artwork deadline
can continue to text-only posting while the image worker is busy. Cancellation
recycles undelivered pixels and preserves the account/notification ownership checks.
